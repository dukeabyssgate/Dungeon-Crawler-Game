The goal is to find the exit to the maze
Each floor will grant you more power
Kill the Tower denizens to absorb their lifeforce
Use your own lifeforce to gain power from the Administrator
The administrator may be generous or not
Climb to the top of the Tower to have your wish granted
I have scattered resurrection crystals across the tower to aid you in your travels
